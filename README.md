# Bowling Kata 

## Goals 
- Learn how to be better teachers by studying katas.
- Focus on follow the kata as written, rather than solving the problem 
  and then referencing back at Uncle Bob's approach.
- Take note of what the kata is trying to teach, what it did well, and what it didn't do well.

## Anti Goals
- Do the entire kata perfectly. 
- Focus too much on making the code neat.
